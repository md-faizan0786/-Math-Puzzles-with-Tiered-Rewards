# Math Puzzles with Tiered Rewards

## Project Description
Math Puzzles with Tiered Rewards is a blockchain-based system designed to gamify learning by offering users rewards for solving math puzzles. The system categorizes puzzles into tiers based on difficulty, with higher rewards for solving more challenging puzzles. Users can accumulate and claim their rewards through a smart contract on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
This project aims to:
- Make math learning interactive and engaging.
- Incentivize users to solve challenging puzzles by providing tier-based rewards.
- Leverage blockchain technology to ensure transparency, fairness, and decentralization.

## Key Features
1. **Tier-Based Puzzle System**:
   - **Tier 1**: Easy puzzles with a reward of 10 tokens.
   - **Tier 2**: Intermediate puzzles with a reward of 50 tokens.
   - **Tier 3**: Advanced puzzles with a reward of 100 tokens.

2. **Reward Management**:
   - Users earn rewards upon solving puzzles based on their chosen tier.
   - Rewards are stored securely on-chain in the user's account.

3. **Reward Claiming**:
   - Users can claim their accumulated rewards at any time through the contract.
   - Ether-based payouts for reward claiming (native token).

4. **Blockchain Transparency**:
   - All transactions and reward allocations are recorded on-chain.
   - Emission of events for puzzle-solving and reward-claiming for easy tracking.




## Deployment Instructions
1. Open the smart contract in Remix or a local development environment.
2. Compile the contract to ensure there are no errors.
3. Deploy the contract to your desired blockchain network.
4. Note the deployed contract address and update this README with the address.
